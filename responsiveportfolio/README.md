First, give your README a title, like “Adrian’s Portfolio,” or even “Responsive Portfolio”.  

Using bootstrap, HTML and css, I made a basic portfolio. I included a nav bar that is consistent on all three pages. 

Although the page is running, I am not able to use the deployable link from github and there are several problems when I run the code through a validator and I do not understand or know how/where to fix the errors.
